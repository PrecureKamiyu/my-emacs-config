# My Config

Nothing has been test.

Although there are some fancy plugin like leetcode.el that can write
leetcode in emacs, but I have kept it simple.

However, the init time is hell.  So I prefer using `emacs --daemon`
for the sake of convienence.

Some most used package:

- blink-search
- helm

Also I use doom theme package, among which I think `solarized-light`
is the best, and `solarized-dark-high-contrast` is good too.

I tried using `obsidian.el`, don't use this shit.  Try using obsidian
with nvim instead.

I also copy the `elpa` dir.  I have no proof that this will work on
your machine.

# my machine

I use ubuntu 20.  `gcc`'s version is around 10.  Idk.  Besides these,
some of the feature may not working:

1. treesitter.  You have to build emacs with tree sitter option.
2. xwwp.  You have to build emacs with xwidget option.
3. icon in blink-search.  You have to build with some option I forget.
